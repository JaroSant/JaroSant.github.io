                    <h2>Hello!</h2>
                    <p>I'm a posdoct at the Dipartimento di Scienze Economico-Sociali e Matematico-Statistiche (<a
                            href="https://www.esomas.unito.it/do/home.pl">ESOMAS</a>)
                        at the Universit√† di Torino, working with <a href="https://www.matteoruggiero.it/">Prof. Matteo
                            Ruggiero</a>. I am also affiliated to the <a href="https://www.carloalberto.org/"> Collegio
                            Carlo Alberto</a>
                        as part of the "de Castro" Statistics Initiative. </p>
                    <p>My main research interests revolve around stochastic processes arising within the field of
                        mathematical population genetics, and how techniques from probability theory, statistical
                        computation and Bayesian analysis can be combined to provide powerful inferential methods to
                        answer pertinent questions within genetics. </p>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Previously, I was a Posdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Oxford working within <a
                            href="https://palamaralab.github.io/">Pier Francesco Palamara&#39;s group</a>. Prior to that
                        I was a
                        Research Fellow at the University of Warwick, where I also completed my PhD in December 2021
                        under the supervision of Paul Jenkins, Jere Koskela and Dario Span&ograve;. I previously studied
                        at Cambridge (Part III) and the University of Malta (BSc).

                    <p>In the summer of 2022 I was one of the organisers of the&nbsp;<em>Stochastic modelling in the
                            life sciences</em>&nbsp;Junior Trimester Programme held at the Hausdorff Research Institute
                        for Mathematics (University of Bonn).</p>
