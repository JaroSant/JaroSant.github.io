<h2>Jaromir Sant</h2>

<p>Hello! I'm Posdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Oxford working within <a href="https://palamaralab.github.io/">Pier Francesco Palamara&#39;s group</a>. I am primarily interested in stochastic processes arising within the field of mathematical population genetics, and how fields such as probability theory, statistical computation and Bayesian analysis can be combined to provide powerful inferential methods and techniques to answer pertinent questions within genetics. Previously I was a Research Fellow at the University of Warwick, where I also completed my PhD in December 2021 under the supervision of Paul Jenkins, Jere Koskela and Dario Span&ograve;. I previously studied at Cambridge (Part III) and the University of Malta (BSc).</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>I am also keen on developing and making available reproducible and portable software:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JaroSant/EWF">EWF</a> - exact diffusion and diffusion bridge simulation for the Wright--Fisher diffusion</p>

<p>In the summer of 2022 I was one of the organisers of the&nbsp;<em>Stochastic modelling in the life sciences</em>&nbsp;Junior Trimester Programme held at the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics (University of Bonn).</p>

<p>I am a Research Associate at Corpus Christi College at Oxford, and member of the Senior Common Room.</p>
